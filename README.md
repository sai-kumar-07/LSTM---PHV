# Bi-LSTM for Human-Dengue Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction

This repository presents a deep learning approach for predicting protein-protein interactions between dengue virus and human proteins using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. Our model achieved an impressive **92.4% AUC score** on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of sequence-based neural architectures for understanding host-pathogen interactions. The research successfully identified biologically relevant pathways, including the Glycosphingolipid biosynthesis pathway known to be exploited by dengue virus for host cell entry, validating the biological significance of our computational predictions.

## Abstract

Proteinâ€“protein interactions between viral and human proteins play a vital role in the development and progression of infectious diseases. Viruses such as the dengue virus often exploit host cell processes by interacting with crucial human proteins, aiding in viral replication, immune system evasion, and the onset of disease symptoms. Gaining insight into these interactions is essential to understand host-pathogen relationships, disruptions in cellular signaling pathways, and identifying potential targets for antiviral therapies.

In this work, protein sequences are encoded using k-mers and processed by separate BiLSTM modelsâ€”one for human and one for dengue proteinsâ€”to generate embeddings. These embeddings are then combined and fed into a fully connected neural network trained on labeled interaction data to predict interactions.

Our model achieved an **AUC score of 92.4%** on the test set. Additionally, the Glycosphingolipid biosynthesis â€“ lacto and neolacto series pathway was enriched in the result of pathway enrichment analysis. This pathway is known to be targeted by the dengue virus for host cell entry, supporting the biological relevance of our predictions.


## Dataset Construction

### Sequence Similarity Filtering
- **Tool Used**: `cdhit` tool for sequence redundancy removal
- **Threshold**: Proteins with >90% similarity were excluded to prevent overfitting
- **Output**: Non-redundant protein sequences for both human and dengue datasets

### K-mer Representation
- **Approach**: 4-mer decomposition of protein sequences
- **Format**: CSV file with protein labels and corresponding 4-mers
- **Word Embedding**: CBOW Word2Vec model training on k-mer sequences

### Negative Sample Preparation
Negative samples were systematically generated based on subcellular localization principles:
- **Rationale**: Proteins in different subcellular compartments are less likely to interact
- **Data Source**: Subcellular localization information for both human and dengue proteins
- **Balancing**: Number of negative samples matched to positive samples

### Word2Vec Model Configuration
- **Architecture**: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)
- **Embedding Dimension**: 128
- **Training Iterations**: 100
- **Implementation**: `w2v_R.ipynb`
